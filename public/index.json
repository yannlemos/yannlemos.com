Plugin for Godot 4.3 and 4.4.\rGDScript 77\r2\rMy Role #\rCreator and Maintainer\nTechnical Details #\rFree and open-source Available in the Godot Asset Library and Github 1.0 release in January 2025 Development Notes #\rOne of the features of Godot that I have always really appreciated is the top-down support in the engine for signals, which are a built-in implementation of what you would call events in C#, for exampe.\nHowever, as a project gets bigger in the engine, it becomes pretty cumbersome to keep track of all the signals at any point in a game\u0026rsquo;s runtime. I faced this problem during a project for a client with Studio Bravarda and decided to take this opportunity to explore the plugin architecture of Godot and try to create a solution that would work for me and the community.\nI was extremely impressed by it and was able to get a plugin working from scratch in two days that did what I wanted: allowing me to see all the signals of a node visually in graph form.\nI decided to release the plugin as a FOSS project, and the reception has been amazing. I hope to keep maintaining it and help it grow alongside Godot. Hopefully, I, alongside contributors, can turn it into the go-to debugger for signals in the Godot ecosystem.\nFeatures #\rClick on a node in the remote scene tree and instantly view all its signals\u0026rsquo; connections View signal emissions in real-time as they are emitted in-game Select and rearrange a graph view to inspect your signal connections Freeze signal emissions so you can inspect them later Modify the signal emission speed so you can fine-tune the experience for your debugging purposes Supports inspection of built-in and custom signals Supports inspection of built-in nodes, custom nodes and autoloads — if - it\u0026rsquo;s in the remote tree, you can inspect it.

Brave the chaos solo or with up to 4 friends, forge your path through hordes of enemies, gather capy-powering weapons \u0026amp; skills and embrace your inner capybara in this action-packed bullet heaven frenzy!\nMy Role #\rLead Programmer, Composer, Sound Designer \u0026amp; Business Developer\nTechnical Details #\rReleased on Steam in December 2023 Coming Q1 2025 to Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5 \u0026amp; Nintendo Switch Developed in Unity Audio created in Logic Pro X, implemented with FMOD Development Notes #\rExtremely Powerful Capybaras (EPC) was a wild ride from start to finish. And it\u0026rsquo;s not even finished yet! It all began as a prototype during the development of Sky Caravan with Studio Bravarda in February 2022. At the time, Vampire Survivors was in the very early stages of being a huge hit, and we saw an opportunity to dive into this new genre with a twist: local multiplayer.\nWhen we revisited EPC after wrapping up Sky Caravan, we faced numerous design and engineering challenges. Curiously, the capybaras were only introduced months into development, but they instantly elevated its appeal. Our participation in Steam Next Fest in October 2022 proved fruitful, as EPC became a hit in both the \u0026ldquo;roguelike\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;multiplayer\u0026rdquo; categories, reaching the Top 10 most played demos and was even one of the most played demos on all of Steam for a while.\nSecuring a publishing deal with PM Studios and later with Logoi Games were significant milestones, and allowed us to greatly expand the reach and potential of the game, especially in China, where most of our player base stems from.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s when we made the biggest decision fo the project: to transform EPC into an online multiplayer game. It was the most daunting technical problem I\u0026rsquo;ve ever faced. None of us had any experience with online development, but we figured out a way. Despite setbacks and delays, we persevered with the support of our partners and players.\nEventually, we made it to December 5th 2023, the release date for the game. The project changed scenarios so many times, new requirements, new challenges, all in my first experience as being a lead programmer. It was crushing at times. But we shipped it.\nExtras #\rThe soundtrack is freely available in my Youtube channel:\nI released some development tools I made for the game publicly.

She animated the whole piece using 2D digital animation mixed with paint on glass, which creates an amazing effect that I was very excited create a soundscape to.\nThe sound design of See is based on two fundamental elements: authentic sound effects of beach and underwater ambiences and the interaction between two melodic motifs, symbolizing the daughter and the mother. To achieve a realistic ambiance for the animation\u0026rsquo;s setting and to create a contrast with the more ethereal moments of the narrative, a combination of effects from online libraries and foley techniques were employed.\nAs for the music, the mother\u0026rsquo;s melody embodies a deep, lower-octave sound with greater intervals between notes, representing age, patience, and care. In contrast, the daughter\u0026rsquo;s melody is constructed upon a 4-note arpeggio, played in higher octaves, signifying playfulness and carefree spirit. However, as the story progresses, the daughter\u0026rsquo;s melody gradually descends, representing her transition from childhood to adulthood and the growing proximity between mother and daughter. Although the melodies initially diverge, they eventually converge into a hybrid melody, symbolizing the strengthening of the bond between mother and daughter. Acoustic instrumentation, such as guitar and piano, was employed to maintain an organic sound and avoid any sense of artificiality.\nIt was a very demanding project, especially given that I was also working on Extremely Powerful Capybaras, but we were both very satisfied with the results after a year of on and off work, with lots of back and forth and pretty good direction from Julia\u0026rsquo;s part. I\u0026rsquo;m excited to be able to show the full animation here, but the short hasn\u0026rsquo;t been released yet, so for now, the trailer gives a good idea of the final result! Also please follow and hire Julia, she\u0026rsquo;s an amazing professional!\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/see/","section":"Projects","summary":"Short Film","title":"See","type":"Project"},{"content":"\rYour browser doesn't support embedded videos, but don't worry, you can download it and watch it with your favorite video player!\rWelcome to the Skyways, caravaneer. Complete missions, manage your ship’s resources and make tough decisions to keep your crew alive and happy. Or not. Choices have lasting consequences in this Text-Based RPG. You are the captain - and the clouds are waiting!\nMy Role #\rGame Designer, Narrative Designer, Writer, Programmer, Composer, Sound Designer \u0026amp; Business Developer\nTechnical Details #\rReleased on Steam in 2022 Released on the Nintendo Switch in 2023 Developed in Unity and written in the Ink scripting language Audio created in Logic Pro X, implemented with FMOD Development Notes #\rSky Caravan is the first game I shipped on PC and a console, and it brings me immense joy to have introduced something so quirky, funny, and uniquely Brazilian into the world.\nOur team at Studio Bravarda embarked on this project as a means to develop a smaller game and get it out the door faster than our then-current project, Terra Pulse. While one of my partners and I were primarily focused on finding publishers, the rest of the team came up with a concept that truly excited us: a narrative game where players choose with emojis, blending elements of Disney’s Treasure Planet with Brazilian culture. I was instantly hooked! We joked at the time about being so tired of dealing with collisions in Terra Pulse (a combat-heavy game) that we decided to make a game with no collisions at all. However, relying solely on words presented its own unique set of challenges.\nDevelopment began in May 2021, and after a full year of hard work, we shipped the game in May 2022. We developed the entire game using the Ink scripting language, a fantastic piece of technology by the folks at Inkle that was mostly a joy to work with, aside from a few hiccups I plan to delve into in a future article. This project marked the first time I was fully immersed in programming, handling all the front-end work for the game.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s an interesting tidbit about this project: initially, we wanted to experiment with a \u0026ldquo;narrative roguelike.\u0026rdquo; We crafted numerous small story moments that were pieced together by a procedural system. Pretty neat right? Well, it resulted in a narrative that felt incredibly flat and was nearly impossible to QA. Realizing this too late in development, around the 8-month mark, I proposed to the team that we completely pivot to a linear, character-driven game, adapting all the story moments into specific tailored events that we could polish to the max. I was scared to death of everyone’s reaction, but to my surprise, the reaction from everyone was “God, please, yes!”. Don\u0026rsquo;t mess with procedural narratives.\nSo we rewrote approximately 50k words of interactive narrative in the next 4 months, along with writing the final 40k words, totaling 180k words in English and Portuguese. It was a wild ride. I\u0026rsquo;m incredibly proud of the end result and we were also fortunate to receive nominations for some cool awards, which meant a lot to us as it was our first game.\nThis project also marked the first time I composed a soundtrack from beginning to end, crafting a complete arc of themes and characters. I can\u0026rsquo;t put into words how fulfilling it was, after a lifetime of playing JRPGs and analyzing their music motifs, to be able to create my own, while incorporating very Brazilian instruments like the pandeiro, nylon guitar, and cavaquinho to create a unique soundscape.\nSeeing my game on a Nintendo console was also a dream come true, made possible thanks to Studio Bravarda’s partnership with RedDeer Games, who handled the porting to the Switch.\nIf someone had told me as a kid that I would one day put a talking anteater chef on a Nintendo console, I’d be flabbergasted—but extremely interested.\nExtras #\rThe soundtrack is freely available in my Youtube channel:\nThe entire game\u0026rsquo;s script is publicly available in my Github:\nyannlemos/Sky-Caravan-Ink\rComplete .ink directory for Sky Caravan.\rInk 20\r1\rI released a video (in portuguese) in my Youtube channel talking about the game, exploring the repo above and talking about some lessons learned, alongside some tips for aspiring game writers:\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/sky-caravan/","section":"Projects","summary":"Game (PC/Nintendo Switch)","title":"Sky Caravan","type":"Project"},{"content":"\rYour browser doesn't support embedded videos, but don't worry, you can download it and watch it with your favorite video player!\rExplore the vast, long-lost ruins of Rio de Janeiro and unravel humanity’s destiny. Slash and dash your way through monster-infested tropical biomes, unearth the stories of its inhabitants and discover the secret behind the Terra Pulse, in a handcrafted and hand-drawn 2D adventure.\nMy Role #\rDirector, Game Designer, Narrative Designer, Writer, Additional Programming, Composer, Sound Designer \u0026amp; Business Developer\nTechnical Details #\rDeveloped in Unity Audio created in Logic Pro X, implemented with FMOD Development Notes #\rTerra Pulse marked Studio Bravarda\u0026rsquo;s inaugural venture back in early 2020. It was a game that intertwined our team\u0026rsquo;s complex relationship with Rio de Janeiro (the city we grew up in), my personal journey with Capoeira—a significant part of my childhood—and our collective passion for the intricate combat of metroidvanias like Hollow Knight, coupled with the exploration elements reminiscent of 2D Zeldas.\nAs is typical with most indie projects, the scope expanded far beyond our initial expectations. Participating in Steam Autumn Festival (before it became Steam Next Fast) garnered a surprisingly positive response, despite the game\u0026rsquo;s still raw, unpolished state. This served as a catalyst for us to seek out a publishing deal, with hopes of fully realizing Terra Pulse\u0026rsquo;s potential. Unfortunately, we weren\u0026rsquo;t able to sign a publisher and, consequently, secure funding, leading us to pivot towards a smaller project, eventually culminating in Sky Caravan.\nIt still breaks my heart that we weren\u0026rsquo;t able to see Terra Pulse through to completion, especially considering my role as the project\u0026rsquo;s director. I intend to write about it in more detail eventually. Our experience holds some necessary insights into the challenges of seeking publishers and everything it entails.\nLooking at the material I\u0026rsquo;ve compiled, i need to admit that it brings mixed feelings, of course. I mean, how many game devs put cancelled projects in their portfolios? Still, I somehow can\u0026rsquo;t help but feel proud about having attemped this with my team. A metroidvania in the ruins of Rio de Janeiro? This is the stuff I dreamed about making games for. I learned so much. I\u0026rsquo;m grateful.\nI remain hopeful that one day, armed with greater experience, I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to fulfill the promise of Terra Pulse.\nExtras #\rA piece of the game\u0026rsquo;s soundtrack:\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/terra-pulse/","section":"Projects","summary":"Game (Unreleased)","title":"Terra Pulse","type":"Project"},{"content":"\rSimple, yet powerful.

So I released Signal Lens, a debugger, Resource Tweens, an animation solution and have been developing StoryTree, for now an in-house graph-based dialogue tool.\rAmidst all this, after a few years of informal mentoring and talks with other indie devs, I've decided to organize my efforts and offer mentoring more formally through Patreon. I've had amazing experiences teaching other game devs and I want to be able to do more of it from now on. I'm really excited to go back to teaching after a few years off of it since leaving my teaching job at Senac-RJ.\rHope next update I'll write that I've completed a 5k running. It's not a lot, but it's an important personal milestone and I've never been closer.\rIt's all been very fulfilling, and I'm feeling pretty good about the rest of the year. 📚 Reading: The Horus Heresy by multiple authors. Yes, I've been grimdark-pilled and no one can stop me, Warhammer 40k is now my religion and the Emperor is my god. Hyperbolisms aside, these books have outperformed every criteria for me. Just pure awesomeness and enjoyment and good writing. I can't help but feel that Horus is top-tier bro, so let's see if next update after reading everything I'll still have the same opinion.\r🎮 Playing: Cities Skylines (PS4). I beat Horizon: Zero Dawn, and it was probably the best open-world game I've ever played. Even did a video analyzing its post-mortem. Then I decided to take a break and indulge in the addictive qualities of city-building. It's my zen place between big games.\r📺 Watching: A Grande Família, yeah, still watching it, I mean, it's like 18 seasons? But I also started watching Rome, the HBO series, and been finding it pretty great. Didn't think a buddy-cop comedy (that's the way I see it) set in the civil-war period of ancient Rome would work so well, but it does!\rJanuary 2025 #2\rForward\rSo basically a half-year happened since my last update, so I'll focus on the highlights:\r• I was diagnosed with ADHD, and this radically changed my life for the better. Been undergoing treatment, taking meds, and I've never been better.\r• That award I mentioned below, we won! Studio Bravarda had an insane 2024 with lots of ups and downs, but we're on the up now. Working on really really cool new projects. I'm excited about making games again.\r• On that note: I'm now a Godot developer. Fuck Unity. Just had my first PR accepted (a typo fix in the documentation, but I'm proud of it) and had my first plugin accepted for the engine, called Signal Lens. I'm deeply loving it and I'll help it thrive.\r• I started a Youtube channel in portuguese to talk about game dev, Godot, which is now my game engine of choice, and share my music, and it has been an amazing experience\r• I'm engaged! I'm getting married!!!\rI guess what I'm doing now is just going forward. It feels good.\r📚 Reading: The Pacific War Trilogy by Ian W. Toll. Blown away by the amount of detail and how deep he goes into the big personalities of the pacific theatre. Absolutely recommend for any WWII history buff.\r🎮 Playing: Horizon: Zero Dawn (PS4), kind of. Been very hectic so it's a bit difficult to find energy to play games.\r📺 Watching: A Grande Família, a legendary tv show here in Brazil that I've been watching reruns of. I had only watched is as a kid/teenager and now as an adult gotta say I love it even more. Also Spy Family, I guess I'm having a disfunctional family season.\rJune 2024 #1\rThe long postponed digital housekeeping\rI'm finally coming back to the internet as an active participant, after a few years lurking. I tuned out of every single social media platform in 2019 and dedicated the last few years quite intensely to my indie game development studio, but I'm finally taking a break from the hustle and using this time to reorganize my digital self, which includes this website. There's lots I want to write about my experience releasing two games in the last four years, and I guess I kinda just need to exist in the internet again, so it's all in good timing.\rI'll be in São Paulo at the end of the month for Gamescom Latam! Extremely Powerful Capybaras has been nominated for Best Multiplayer Game, which is amazing and a treasure at the end of the cave after two years of the development. 📚 Reading: The Dragonbone Chair by Tad Williams and Hackers: Heroes Of The Computer Revolution by Steven Levy.\r🎮 Playing: Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance (Gamecube) and finishing up the War Room missions of Advance Wars: Black Hole Rising (Game Boy Advance).\r📺 Watching: Rewatching Season 1 of The Bear and trying my hardest to juggle all the Eurocup and Copa América games.\r","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/now/","section":"Yann Lemos","summary":"","title":"Now","type":"page"},{"content":"My Patreon serves two purposes: it\u0026rsquo;s a way to make it easier to support my work and also to be a place where I offer mentorships for game developers.\nI\u0026rsquo;m using this page to help you better understand how the Patreon works and what mentorship means to me.\nWhy seek a mentor? #\rThere\u0026rsquo;s Youtube tutorials everywhere and it has never been easier to learn to code and make a game by yourself, with LLMs etc\u0026hellip; right?\nWell, let me share an illuminating example: me.\nI started out as a game designer and learned how to program in Unity by following tutorials.\nI came to a certain point (which will be familiar to many game developers) where you go: \u0026ldquo;Ok, but I want to make my own code, not just follow tutorials\u0026rdquo;.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a very frustrating bottleneck, and one in which I believe many give up. I didn\u0026rsquo;t, however, and proceeded to spend years learning by myself.\nI learned so much stuff wrong. So much. Not knowing how to parse the multitude of information on the internet about game development, I just blazed my way through and got burned in the process.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why I decided to start mentoring developers: I don\u0026rsquo;t want people to suffer like I did. The process can be smoother, all the while still being challenging and incredibly rewarding.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been pretty great!\nI taught for four years in Brazil\u0026rsquo;s biggest professional education institution (Senac-RJ), honing my skills as a teacher in a PBL (Project-Based Learning) approach, lecturing in design, game development and marketing classes. That\u0026rsquo;s why my mentorships are project-based: you learn how to make games by making games.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll help you avoid pitfalls and structure your knowledge in an order that makes sense for your goals. That way, you can finally go beyong tutorials, avoid waste and unnecessary hardships. They can be about programming, design, business, mental health, strategy — I share what I\u0026rsquo;ve learned as you need it.\nI want to help people become the game devs they dream of, without burning in the process.\nThat is what I wish I had, and am super excited to offer.\nMentorship Tiers #\rGroup Mentorship - $100/month: You\u0026rsquo;ll have access to a weekly 2-hour collective call with 4 other students of various backgrounds to work on complex projects and get direct feedback from me. You\u0026rsquo;ll also have access to the student discord server where you can share your projects and get feedback if that\u0026rsquo;s interesting to you! We\u0026rsquo;ll work in the Godot game engine.\nPersonal Mentorship - $200/month: You\u0026rsquo;ll have access to a weekly 2-hour individual call with me and I\u0026rsquo;ll propose unique projects for you to work on that match the games you want to make. We\u0026rsquo;ll work together on these calls and I\u0026rsquo;ll push you and share all I\u0026rsquo;ve learned. You\u0026rsquo;ll also have access to the student discord server where you can share your projects and get feedback if that\u0026rsquo;s interesting to you!

I recommend subscribing the basic tier of my Patreon ($2), or, if you\u0026rsquo;re using one my tools or is just an awesome person, I recommend the second tier ($10) and you\u0026rsquo;ll also have access to personalized support for any tool of mine.\n\u0026ldquo;I want to learn game development with you, but I’m a total beginner.\u0026quot;I\u0026rsquo;m really glad you found something you\u0026rsquo;re so interested in. However, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend doing your first steps by following Youtube tutorials, like the ones offered freely by Brackeys. A mentorship is an expensive commitment and I believe it\u0026rsquo;s best to take this leap when you\u0026rsquo;re at the point of \u0026ldquo;Ok, I like this, I really want to do this and it\u0026rsquo;s time to go beyond tutorials.\u0026rdquo; I also recommend learning in Godot, which is a free and open-source game engine, and my tool of choice for making games.\n\u0026ldquo;I have some experience, but I want to learn game development with you\u0026rdquo;. Then you\u0026rsquo;ll be super welcome in my group mentorship! I suggest signing up to the collective mentorship ($100). We\u0026rsquo;ll work in the Godot game engine.\n\u0026ldquo;I have some experience, but want to learn game development with you and I prefer a more personalized approach and/or don\u0026rsquo;t want to work with Godot\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;ll be happy to guide you! I suggest signing up to the personal mentorship ($200). We\u0026rsquo;ll work with the game engine of your choice.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d love to learn with you but I don\u0026rsquo;t have the financial means. Is there any scholarship or discount available?\u0026quot; Unfortunately no, not at the moment. I really want to open pro-bono slots, but it\u0026rsquo;s not feasible financially for me at the moment. It\u0026rsquo;s one of my priorities though, and I hope to make it into a reality by the end of 2025.

Before I reached out, I had been learning Godot and programming on my own for a little over a year through online tutorials, videos and Udemy. Though great resources, I felt like I was just “copying and pasting” information instead of actually “learning it”. I understood some of the concepts but I simply couldn’t put anything into practice on my own.\nYann is sharp, compassionate, and genuinely passionate about teaching. He understands where I am as a student and has been finding different and smart ways to approach the concepts I struggle with, so at the end of every session I’m always feeling accomplished and pumped for the next step. From our very first session, Yann gave me a sense of clarity and self-assurance. I went from thinking, “Wouldn’t it be cool if I could do something like this?” to realizing, “Wait, I’m already doing it.\u0026rdquo;\n— Gustavo Kawika (Dallas, USA)\nPerfect! A teacher with deep knowledge in game development! He’s also a musician and has worked on several projects, bringing a bunch of experience that can help beginner students at their own pace.\nGive Yann a chance—I really enjoyed learning from him.\n— Stephan Castiglioni (Vitória, Brazil)\nI highly recommend Yann! Not only does he have a great teaching style, but he is also incredibly calm. He genuinely cares about your learning and makes sure you understand everything before moving forward.\nA major strength is his ability to adapt to your level of knowledge—he explains the absolute basics until they stick or dives into advanced topics with mastery, all to help you in the best way possible. He is one of the most patient, good-humored, and adaptable teachers I\u0026rsquo;ve ever met. I learned so much from Yann!\n— Luiza Arantes (Vancouver, Canada)\nDisclaimers \u0026amp; FAQ #\rAbout vacancies and waiting list: Both mentoring tier have limited vacancies because I dedicate the majority of my time to my work. Patreon doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a waiting list, so I recommend signing up to the basic tier ($5) and get into the student discord server, so you can stay tuned at the end/beginning of each month, when vacancies may open up.\nAbout vacations: Every year I\u0026rsquo;ll take breaks/vacations in dates communicated with at least a month of antecedence, so there will be no mentoring and no posts in those months — you can stop paying, but if you are my mentee, your spot will remain open and can be filled by someone else.\nAbout the mentoring calls: The mentoring calls are hands-on work, where you\u0026rsquo;ll be in your game engine and I\u0026rsquo;ll be accompanying you and at times sharing my screen to show/teach/debug something. The calls will be scheduled at least 1 week in advance, with a non-negotiable day/time (always in Brazilian time) and won\u0026rsquo;t be recorded, but you can record if you\u0026rsquo;d like.\nAbout absences: If you\u0026rsquo;re doing the personal mentoring and miss a scheduled call without at least a 12-hour warning, unless it\u0026rsquo;s an absolute emergency, I\u0026rsquo;ll unfortunately have to stop the mentorship with you and vacate your slot. I have been subjected to enough instances of students just \u0026ldquo;forgetting\u0026rdquo; and I think it\u0026rsquo;s deeply disrespectful, and I can\u0026rsquo;t teach someone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t respect my time. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of prep that goes into the mentorship and I\u0026rsquo;m letting go of doing my own work for it. It may seem harsh, but it\u0026rsquo;s important and non-negotiable.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/mentorships/","section":"Yann Lemos","summary":"","title":"Patreon \u0026 Mentorships","type":"page"},{"content":" ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Projects","type":"projects"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/software/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Software","type":"tags"}]
