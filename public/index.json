Plugin for Godot 4.3 and 4.4.\rGDScript 77\r2\rMy Role #\rCreator and Maintainer\nTechnical Details #\rFree and open-source Available in the Godot Asset Library and Github 1.0 release in January 2025 Development Notes #\rOne of the features of Godot that I have always really appreciated is the top-down support in the engine for signals, which are a built-in implementation of what you would call events in C#, for exampe.\nHowever, as a project gets bigger in the engine, it becomes pretty cumbersome to keep track of all the signals at any point in a game\u0026rsquo;s runtime. I faced this problem during a project for a client with Studio Bravarda and decided to take this opportunity to explore the plugin architecture of Godot and try to create a solution that would work for me and the community.\nI was extremely impressed by it and was able to get a plugin working from scratch in two days that did what I wanted: allowing me to see all the signals of a node visually in graph form.\nI decided to release the plugin as a FOSS project, and the reception has been amazing. I hope to keep maintaining it and help it grow alongside Godot. Hopefully, I, alongside contributors, can turn it into the go-to debugger for signals in the Godot ecosystem.\nFeatures #\rClick on a node in the remote scene tree and instantly view all its signals\u0026rsquo; connections View signal emissions in real-time as they are emitted in-game Select and rearrange a graph view to inspect your signal connections Freeze signal emissions so you can inspect them later Modify the signal emission speed so you can fine-tune the experience for your debugging purposes Supports inspection of built-in and custom signals Supports inspection of built-in nodes, custom nodes and autoloads — if - it\u0026rsquo;s in the remote tree, you can inspect it.

Brave the chaos solo or with up to 4 friends, forge your path through hordes of enemies, gather capy-powering weapons \u0026amp; skills and embrace your inner capybara in this action-packed bullet heaven frenzy!\nMy Role #\rLead Programmer, Composer, Sound Designer \u0026amp; Business Developer\nTechnical Details #\rReleased on Steam in December 2023 Coming Q1 2025 to Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5 \u0026amp; Nintendo Switch Developed in Unity Audio created in Logic Pro X, implemented with FMOD Development Notes #\rExtremely Powerful Capybaras (EPC) was a wild ride from start to finish. And it\u0026rsquo;s not even finished yet! It all began as a prototype during the development of Sky Caravan with Studio Bravarda in February 2022. At the time, Vampire Survivors was in the very early stages of being a huge hit, and we saw an opportunity to dive into this new genre with a twist: local multiplayer.\nWhen we revisited EPC after wrapping up Sky Caravan, we faced numerous design and engineering challenges. Curiously, the capybaras were only introduced months into development, but they instantly elevated its appeal. Our participation in Steam Next Fest in October 2022 proved fruitful, as EPC became a hit in both the \u0026ldquo;roguelike\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;multiplayer\u0026rdquo; categories, reaching the Top 10 most played demos and was even one of the most played demos on all of Steam for a while.\nSecuring a publishing deal with PM Studios and later with Logoi Games were significant milestones, and allowed us to greatly expand the reach and potential of the game, especially in China, where most of our player base stems from.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s when we made the biggest decision fo the project: to transform EPC into an online multiplayer game. It was the most daunting technical problem I\u0026rsquo;ve ever faced. None of us had any experience with online development, but we figured out a way. Despite setbacks and delays, we persevered with the support of our partners and players.\nEventually, we made it to December 5th 2023, the release date for the game. The project changed scenarios so many times, new requirements, new challenges, all in my first experience as being a lead programmer. It was crushing at times. But we shipped it.\nExtras #\rThe soundtrack is freely available in my Youtube channel:\nI released some development tools I made for the game publicly.

She animated the whole piece using 2D digital animation mixed with paint on glass, which creates an amazing effect that I was very excited create a soundscape to.\nThe sound design of See is based on two fundamental elements: authentic sound effects of beach and underwater ambiences and the interaction between two melodic motifs, symbolizing the daughter and the mother. To achieve a realistic ambiance for the animation\u0026rsquo;s setting and to create a contrast with the more ethereal moments of the narrative, a combination of effects from online libraries and foley techniques were employed.\nAs for the music, the mother\u0026rsquo;s melody embodies a deep, lower-octave sound with greater intervals between notes, representing age, patience, and care. In contrast, the daughter\u0026rsquo;s melody is constructed upon a 4-note arpeggio, played in higher octaves, signifying playfulness and carefree spirit. However, as the story progresses, the daughter\u0026rsquo;s melody gradually descends, representing her transition from childhood to adulthood and the growing proximity between mother and daughter. Although the melodies initially diverge, they eventually converge into a hybrid melody, symbolizing the strengthening of the bond between mother and daughter. Acoustic instrumentation, such as guitar and piano, was employed to maintain an organic sound and avoid any sense of artificiality.\nIt was a very demanding project, especially given that I was also working on Extremely Powerful Capybaras, but we were both very satisfied with the results after a year of on and off work, with lots of back and forth and pretty good direction from Julia\u0026rsquo;s part. I\u0026rsquo;m excited to be able to show the full animation here, but the short hasn\u0026rsquo;t been released yet, so for now, the trailer gives a good idea of the final result!

Complete missions, manage your ship’s resources and make tough decisions to keep your crew alive and happy. Or not. Choices have lasting consequences in this Text-Based RPG. You are the captain - and the clouds are waiting!\nMy Role #\rGame Designer, Narrative Designer, Writer, Programmer, Composer, Sound Designer \u0026amp; Business Developer\nTechnical Details #\rReleased on Steam in 2022 Released on the Nintendo Switch in 2023 Developed in Unity and written in the Ink scripting language Audio created in Logic Pro X, implemented with FMOD Development Notes #\rSky Caravan is the first game I shipped on PC and a console, and it brings me immense joy to have introduced something so quirky, funny, and uniquely Brazilian into the world.\nOur team at Studio Bravarda embarked on this project as a means to develop a smaller game and get it out the door faster than our then-current project, Terra Pulse. While one of my partners and I were primarily focused on finding publishers, the rest of the team came up with a concept that truly excited us: a narrative game where players choose with emojis, blending elements of Disney’s Treasure Planet with Brazilian culture. I was instantly hooked! We joked at the time about being so tired of dealing with collisions in Terra Pulse (a combat-heavy game) that we decided to make a game with no collisions at all. However, relying solely on words presented its own unique set of challenges.\nDevelopment began in May 2021, and after a full year of hard work, we shipped the game in May 2022. We developed the entire game using the Ink scripting language, a fantastic piece of technology by the folks at Inkle that was mostly a joy to work with, aside from a few hiccups I plan to delve into in a future article. This project marked the first time I was fully immersed in programming, handling all the front-end work for the game.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s an interesting tidbit about this project: initially, we wanted to experiment with a \u0026ldquo;narrative roguelike.\u0026rdquo; We crafted numerous small story moments that were pieced together by a procedural system. Pretty neat right? Well, it resulted in a narrative that felt incredibly flat and was nearly impossible to QA. Realizing this too late in development, around the 8-month mark, I proposed to the team that we completely pivot to a linear, character-driven game, adapting all the story moments into specific tailored events that we could polish to the max. I was scared to death of everyone’s reaction, but to my surprise, the reaction from everyone was “God, please, yes!”. Don\u0026rsquo;t mess with procedural narratives.\nSo we rewrote approximately 50k words of interactive narrative in the next 4 months, along with writing the final 40k words, totaling 180k words in English and Portuguese. It was a wild ride. I\u0026rsquo;m incredibly proud of the end result and we were also fortunate to receive nominations for some cool awards, which meant a lot to us as it was our first game.\nThis project also marked the first time I composed a soundtrack from beginning to end, crafting a complete arc of themes and characters. I can\u0026rsquo;t put into words how fulfilling it was, after a lifetime of playing JRPGs and analyzing their music motifs, to be able to create my own, while incorporating very Brazilian instruments like the pandeiro, nylon guitar, and cavaquinho to create a unique soundscape.\nSeeing my game on a Nintendo console was also a dream come true, made possible thanks to Studio Bravarda’s partnership with RedDeer Games, who handled the porting to the Switch.\nIf someone had told me as a kid that I would one day put a talking anteater chef on a Nintendo console, I’d be flabbergasted—but extremely interested.\nExtras #\rThe soundtrack is freely available in my Youtube channel:\nThe entire game\u0026rsquo;s script is publicly available in my Github:\nyannlemos/Sky-Caravan-Ink\rComplete .ink directory for Sky Caravan.\rInk 20\r1\rI released a video (in portuguese) in my Youtube channel talking about the game, exploring the repo above and talking about some lessons learned, alongside some tips for aspiring game writers:\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/sky-caravan/","section":"Projects","summary":"Game (PC/Nintendo Switch)","title":"Sky Caravan","type":"Project"},{"content":"\rYour browser doesn't support embedded videos, but don't worry, you can download it and watch it with your favorite video player!\rExplore the vast, long-lost ruins of Rio de Janeiro and unravel humanity’s destiny. Slash and dash your way through monster-infested tropical biomes, unearth the stories of its inhabitants and discover the secret behind the Terra Pulse, in a handcrafted and hand-drawn 2D adventure.\nMy Role #\rDirector, Game Designer, Narrative Designer, Writer, Additional Programming, Composer, Sound Designer \u0026amp; Business Developer\nTechnical Details #\rDeveloped in Unity Audio created in Logic Pro X, implemented with FMOD Development Notes #\rTerra Pulse marked Studio Bravarda\u0026rsquo;s inaugural venture back in early 2020. It was a game that intertwined our team\u0026rsquo;s complex relationship with Rio de Janeiro (the city we grew up in), my personal journey with Capoeira—a significant part of my childhood—and our collective passion for the intricate combat of metroidvanias like Hollow Knight, coupled with the exploration elements reminiscent of 2D Zeldas.\nAs is typical with most indie projects, the scope expanded far beyond our initial expectations. Participating in Steam Autumn Festival (before it became Steam Next Fast) garnered a surprisingly positive response, despite the game\u0026rsquo;s still raw, unpolished state. This served as a catalyst for us to seek out a publishing deal, with hopes of fully realizing Terra Pulse\u0026rsquo;s potential. Unfortunately, we weren\u0026rsquo;t able to sign a publisher and, consequently, secure funding, leading us to pivot towards a smaller project, eventually culminating in Sky Caravan.\nIt still breaks my heart that we weren\u0026rsquo;t able to see Terra Pulse through to completion, especially considering my role as the project\u0026rsquo;s director. I intend to write about it in more detail eventually. Our experience holds some necessary insights into the challenges of seeking publishers and everything it entails.\nLooking at the material I\u0026rsquo;ve compiled, i need to admit that it brings mixed feelings, of course. I mean, how many game devs put cancelled projects in their portfolios? Still, I somehow can\u0026rsquo;t help but feel proud about having attemped this with my team. A metroidvania in the ruins of Rio de Janeiro? This is the stuff I dreamed about making games for. I learned so much. I\u0026rsquo;m grateful.\nI remain hopeful that one day, armed with greater experience, I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to fulfill the promise of Terra Pulse.\nExtras #\rA piece of the game\u0026rsquo;s soundtrack:\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/terra-pulse/","section":"Projects","summary":"Game (Unreleased)","title":"Terra Pulse","type":"Project"},{"content":"\rSimple, yet powerful.

Been undergoing treatment, taking meds, and I've never been better.\r• That award I mentioned below, we won! Studio Bravarda had an insane 2024 with lots of ups and downs, but we're on the up now. Working on really really cool new projects. I'm excited about making games again.\r• On that note: I'm now a Godot developer. Fuck Unity. Just had my first PR accepted (a typo fix in the documentation, but I'm proud of it) and had my first plugin accepted for the engine, called Signal Lens. I'm deeply loving it and I'll help it thrive.\r• I started a Youtube channel in portuguese to talk about game dev, Godot, which is now my game engine of choice, and share my music, and it has been an amazing experience\r• I'm engaged! I'm getting married!!!\rI guess what I'm doing now is just going forward. It feels good.\r📚 Reading: The Pacific War Trilogy by Ian W. Toll. Blown away by the amount of detail and how deep he goes into the big personalities of the pacific theatre. Absolutely recommend for any WWII history buff.\r🎮 Playing: Horizon: Zero Dawn (PS4), kind of. Been very hectic so it's a bit difficult to find energy to play games.\r📺 Watching: A Grande Família, a legendary tv show here in Brazil that I've been watching reruns of. I had only watched is as a kid/teenager and now as an adult gotta say I love it even more. Also Spy Family, I guess I'm having a disfunctional family season.\rJune 2024 #1\rThe long postponed digital housekeeping\rI'm finally coming back to the internet as an active participant, after a few years lurking. I tuned out of every single social media platform in 2019 and dedicated the last few years quite intensely to my indie game development studio, but I'm finally taking a break from the hustle and using this time to reorganize my digital self, which includes this website. There's lots I want to write about my experience releasing two games in the last four years, and I guess I kinda just need to exist in the internet again, so it's all in good timing.\rI'll be in São Paulo at the end of the month for Gamescom Latam! Extremely Powerful Capybaras has been nominated for Best Multiplayer Game, which is amazing and a treasure at the end of the cave after two years of the development. 📚 Reading: The Dragonbone Chair by Tad Williams and Hackers: Heroes Of The Computer Revolution by Steven Levy.\r🎮 Playing: Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance (Gamecube) and finishing up the War Room missions of Advance Wars: Black Hole Rising (Game Boy Advance).\r📺 Watching: Rewatching Season 1 of The Bear and trying my hardest to juggle all the Eurocup and Copa América games.\r","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/now/","section":"Yann Lemos","summary":"","title":"Now","type":"page"},{"content":"\rSimple, yet powerful.
