Hey there! 👋<br>
{{< /lead >}}

I'm Yann. I'm passionate about [#gamedev]({{< ref "/tags/game-dev" >}}), [#audio]({{< ref "/tags/audio" >}}) and [#writing]({{< ref "/tags/writing" >}}). My projects have collected some accolades in the last few years, which is pretty cool!

• I started [Studio Bravarda](https://studiobravarda.com/home-en) with friends a few years ago, and I'm proud to have shipped the games <i>[Extremely Powerful Capybaras](({{< ref "/projects/extremely-powerful-capybaras" >}}))</i> (PC) and <i>[Sky Caravan](({{< ref "/projects/sky-caravan" >}}))</i> (PC & Switch), the latter receiving nominations for Best Brazilian Game, Best Narrative, and Most Innovative in industry award shows and the former having just been nominated for Best Multiplayer Game at Gamescom Latam.

• I'm also a musician and have composed the soundtrack and crafted the sound design for all of Studio Bravarda's games. Additionally, I recently worked on the short film <i>[See](({{< ref "/projects/see" >}}))</i>, directed by Julia Nicolescu, which is in the official selection for Monstra Lisboa Animation Festival 2024.

• I teach design and game development and was a part-time instructor for a few years at [Senac-RJ](https://www.rj.senac.br/), one of Brazil's most important professional education institutions. During that time, I also created new courses for audiovisual and graphic design and rewrote Senac-RJ's curriculum for game design.

• While studying design at PUC-Rio, I co-founded the game development student group that became [Prisma Game Lab](https://prismagamelab.itch.io/), which will soon be 10 years old and is responsible for dozens of industry placements, providing hands-on experience in game development for hundreds of college students.

• I specialize in Unity and C#, with over 8 years of experience in developing games in the engine while working in multiple roles such as game designer, engineer, writer, and many more. In audio specifically, I have extensive experience implementing interactive sound with FMOD and Logic Pro X.

Feel free to get in touch and take a look around!
