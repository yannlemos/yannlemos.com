I'm finally coming back to the internet as an active participant, after a few years lurking. I tuned out of every single social media platform in 2019 and dedicated the last few years quite intensely to my indie game development studio, but I'm finally taking a break from the hustle and using this time to reorganize my digital self, which includes this website. There's lots I want to write about my experience releasing two games in the last four years, and I guess I kinda just need to exist in the internet again, so it's all in good timing.
<br><br>
I'll be in SÃ£o Paulo at the end of the month for Gamescom Latam! Extremely Powerful Capybaras has been nominated for Best Multiplayer Game, which is amazing and a treasure at the end of the cave after two years of the development.
