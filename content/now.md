This is part of the [Now Movement](https://nownownow.com/about).<br> I'll be updating this page whenever my life updates.<br> Also, timelines are cool for reminiscing.

So basically a half-year happened since my last update, so I'll focus on the highlights:
<br><br>â€¢ I was diagnosed with ADHD, and this radically changed my life for the better. Been undergoing treatment, taking meds, and I've never been better.
<br><br>â€¢ That award I mentioned below, we won! Studio Bravarda had an insane 2024 with lots of ups and downs, but we're on the up now. Working on really really cool new projects. I'm excited about making games again.
<br><br>â€¢ On that note: I'm now a Godot developer. Fuck Unity. Just had my first PR accepted (a typo fix in the documentation, but I'm proud of it) and had my first plugin accepted for the engine, called Signal Lens. I'm deeply loving it and I'll help it thrive.
<br><br>â€¢ I started a Youtube channel in portuguese to talk about game dev, Godot, which is now my game engine of choice, and share my music, and it has been an amazing experience
<br><br>â€¢ I'm engaged! I'm getting married!!!

<br><br>
I guess what I'm doing now is just going forward. It feels good.

<br> ðŸ“š Reading:</b> <i>The Pacific War Trilogy</i> by Ian W. Toll. Blown away by the amount of detail and how deep he goes into the big personalities of the pacific theatre. Absolutely recommend for any WWII history buff.
<br><br><b> ðŸŽ® Playing:</b> <i>Horizon: Zero Dawn</i> (PS4), kind of. Been very hectic so it's a bit difficult to find energy to play games.
<br><br><b> ðŸ“º Watching:</b> <i>A Grande FamÃ­lia</i>, a legendary tv show here in Brazil that I've been watching reruns of. I had only watched is as a kid/teenager and now as an adult gotta say I love it even more. Also <i>Spy Family</i>, I guess I'm having a disfunctional family season.

I'm finally coming back to the internet as an active participant, after a few years lurking. I tuned out of every single social media platform in 2019 and dedicated the last few years quite intensely to my indie game development studio, but I'm finally taking a break from the hustle and using this time to reorganize my digital self, which includes this website. There's lots I want to write about my experience releasing two games in the last four years, and I guess I kinda just need to exist in the internet again, so it's all in good timing.
<br><br>
I'll be in SÃ£o Paulo at the end of the month for Gamescom Latam! Extremely Powerful Capybaras has been nominated for Best Multiplayer Game, which is amazing and a treasure at the end of the cave after two years of the development.   

<br><br><b> ðŸ“š Reading:</b> <i>The Dragonbone Chair</i> by Tad Williams and <i>Hackers: Heroes Of The Computer Revolution</i> by Steven Levy.
