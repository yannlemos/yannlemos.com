This is part of the [Now Movement](https://nownownow.com/about).<br> I'll be updating this page whenever my life updates.<br> Also, timelines are cool for reminiscing.

I've had quite a hectic, but really great start of 2025. I've wrapped my first Godot project (external project under NDA, so no sharing for now) and it had a great response. Godot fulfilled all its promises for me and more. I couldn't be happier.
<br><br>
So I started making tools for it! It just makes sense that I'd become a tool-maker, coming from a design background into programming. So I released <a href="https://github.com/yannlemos/signal-lens">Signal Lens</a>, a debugger, <a href="https://github.com/yannlemos/Resource-Tweens">Resource Tweens</a>, an animation solution and have been developing <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/yann-lemos.bsky.social/post/3lloxlzuq4s2z">StoryTree</a>, for now an in-house graph-based dialogue tool.
<br><br>

Amidst all this, after a few years of informal mentoring and talks with other indie devs, I've decided to organize my efforts and offer mentoring more formally through <a href="https://www.patreon.com/yannlemos">Patreon</a>. I've had amazing experiences teaching other game devs and I want to be able to do more of it from now on. I'm really excited to go back to teaching after a few years off of it since leaving my teaching job at Senac-RJ.
<br><br>
Hope next update I'll write that I've completed a 5k running. It's not a lot, but it's an important personal milestone and I've never been closer.
<br><br>
It's all been very fulfilling, and I'm feeling pretty good about the rest of the year. 

<br>

<br> ðŸ“š Reading:</b> <i>The Horus Heresy</i> by multiple authors. Yes, I've been grimdark-pilled and no one can stop me, Warhammer 40k is now my religion and the Emperor is my god. Hyperbolisms aside, these books have outperformed every criteria for me. Just pure awesomeness and enjoyment and good writing. I can't help but feel that Horus is top-tier bro, so let's see if next update after reading everything I'll still have the same opinion.
<br><br><b> ðŸŽ® Playing:</b> <i>Cities Skylines</i> (PS4). I beat Horizon: Zero Dawn, and it was probably the best open-world game I've ever played. Even did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQJ5CEDpEIA">video</a> analyzing its post-mortem. Then I decided to take a break and indulge in the addictive qualities of city-building. It's my zen place between big games.
<br><br><b> ðŸ“º Watching:</b> <i>A Grande FamÃ­lia</i>, yeah, still watching it, I mean, it's like 18 seasons? But I also started watching <i>Rome</i>, the HBO series, and been finding it pretty great. Didn't think a buddy-cop comedy (that's the way I see it) set in the civil-war period of ancient Rome would work so well, but it does!

So basically a half-year happened since my last update, so I'll focus on the highlights:
<br><br>â€¢ I was diagnosed with ADHD, and this radically changed my life for the better. Been undergoing treatment, taking meds, and I've never been better.
<br><br>â€¢ That award I mentioned below, we won! Studio Bravarda had an insane 2024 with lots of ups and downs, but we're on the up now. Working on really really cool new projects. I'm excited about making games again.
<br><br>â€¢ On that note: I'm now a Godot developer. Fuck Unity. Just had my first PR accepted (a typo fix in the documentation, but I'm proud of it) and had my first plugin accepted for the engine, called Signal Lens. I'm deeply loving it and I'll help it thrive.
<br><br>â€¢ I started a Youtube channel in portuguese to talk about game dev, Godot, which is now my game engine of choice, and share my music, and it has been an amazing experience
<br><br>â€¢ I'm engaged! I'm getting married!!!

<br><br>
I guess what I'm doing now is just going forward. It feels good.
<br>

<br> ðŸ“š Reading:</b> <i>The Pacific War Trilogy</i> by Ian W. Toll. Blown away by the amount of detail and how deep he goes into the big personalities of the pacific theatre. Absolutely recommend for any WWII history buff.
<br><br><b> ðŸŽ® Playing:</b> <i>Horizon: Zero Dawn</i> (PS4), kind of. Been very hectic so it's a bit difficult to find energy to play games.
<br><br><b> ðŸ“º Watching:</b> <i>A Grande FamÃ­lia</i>, a legendary tv show here in Brazil that I've been watching reruns of. I had only watched is as a kid/teenager and now as an adult gotta say I love it even more. Also <i>Spy Family</i>, I guess I'm having a disfunctional family season.

{{< timelineItem icon="location-dot" header="June 2024" badge="#1" subheader="The long postponed digital housekeeping" >}}

I'm finally coming back to the internet as an active participant, after a few years lurking. I tuned out of every single social media platform in 2019 and dedicated the last few years quite intensely to my indie game development studio, but I'm finally taking a break from the hustle and using this time to reorganize my digital self, which includes this website. There's lots I want to write about my experience releasing two games in the last four years, and I guess I kinda just need to exist in the internet again, so it's all in good timing.
<br><br>
I'll be in SÃ£o Paulo at the end of the month for Gamescom Latam! Extremely Powerful Capybaras has been nominated for Best Multiplayer Game, which is amazing and a treasure at the end of the cave after two years of the development.   

<br><br><b> ðŸ“š Reading:</b> <i>The Dragonbone Chair</i> by Tad Williams and <i>Hackers: Heroes Of The Computer Revolution</i> by Steven Levy.
<br><br><b> ðŸŽ® Playing:</b> <i>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</i> (Gamecube) and finishing up the War Room missions of <i>Advance Wars: Black Hole Rising</i> (Game Boy Advance)</b>.
<br><br><b> ðŸ“º Watching:</b> Rewatching Season 1 of <i>The Bear</i> and trying my hardest to juggle all the Eurocup and Copa AmÃ©rica games</b>.
