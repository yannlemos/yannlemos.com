### Development Notes

Extremely Powerful Capybaras (EPC) was a wild ride from start to finish. And it's not even finished yet! It all began as a prototype during the development of Sky Caravan with Studio Bravarda in February 2022. At the time, Vampire Survivors was in the very early stages of being a huge hit, and we saw an opportunity to dive into this new genre with a twist: local multiplayer.

When we revisited EPC after wrapping up Sky Caravan, we faced numerous design and engineering challenges. Curiously, the capybaras were only introduced months into development, but they instantly elevated its appeal. Our participation in Steam Next Fest in October 2022 proved fruitful, as EPC became a hit in both the "roguelike" and "multiplayer" categories, reaching the Top 10 most played demos and was even one of the most played demos on all of Steam for a while.

Securing a publishing deal with PM Studios and later with Logoi Games were significant milestones, and allowed us to greatly expand the reach and potential of the game, especially in China, where most of our player base stems from.

That's when we made the biggest decision fo the project: to transform EPC into an online multiplayer game. It was the most daunting technical problem I've ever faced. None of us had any experience with online development, but we figured out a way. Despite setbacks and delays, we persevered with the support of our partners and players.

Eventually, we made it to December 5th 2023, the release date for the game, and shipped it. The project changed scenarios so many times, new requirements, new challenges, all in my first experience as being a lead programmer. It was crushing at times. 

But we shipped it. 

We unfortunately weren't able to release it in as stable as state as we'd like. If you look at it right now on Steam, it has mixed reviews, which is something no developer dreams of. However, given how the roller coaster that was development, and the colossal task that was implementing online, It is absolutely fair to say that we did the best we could, and we're still doing it.

This is the game that I am currently working on at Studio Bravarda, and we hope to improve the review scores in the coming updates. If there's one thing that we can appreciate about this moment in the games industry, is that games have second chances, and we're very fortunate to have great partners and players to help us reach our goal. 

### Extras

I open-sourced a few important scripts and tools used in the game. They're available in my Github.
